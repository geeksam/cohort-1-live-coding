( UPDATED BASED ON YOUR FEEDBACK :D )

Scoring a hand!
I usually build a hash that looks like this:

{
  '9' => 0,
  'T' => 3,
  'J' => 0,
  'Q' => 0,
  'K' => 2,
  'A' => 0,
}

Quotes!

  "Tests are the Programmer's Stone, transmuting fear into boredom."
  - Kent Beck

  "Even for experts, programming is an exploratory process.  We
  experiment with libraries, run through examples and iteratively build
  up features.  One of the most painful lessons beginners have to learn
  is just how often everyone is wrong about everything.  Tightening the
  feedback loop between writing code and seeing the results reduces the
  damage caused by wrong assumptions, lightens the cognitive load of
  tracking what should be happening and helps build accurate mental
  models of the system. The latter is especially important for beginners
  who often suffer from miscomprehensions about even the basic semantics
  of the language."
